# US-Gas-Prices

Python scripts that scrape US gas prices.

> 👋 This repository's maintainer is available to hire for US gas prices data-extraction consulting projects. To get a cost estimate, send email to lallyelias87@gmail.com (for projects of any size or complexity).

## Requirements

- [Python 3.10.19+](https://www.python.org/)
- [pip 24.2+](https://github.com/pypa/pip)
- [selenium 4.14.0+](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/trunk/py)
- [webdriver-manager 4.0.2+](https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager)
- [pandas 2.0.3+](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)

## Usage

- Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lykmapipo/US-Gas-Prices.git
cd US-Gas-Prices
```

- Install all dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To scrape [state gas price daily averages](https://gasprices.aaa.com/state-gas-price-averages/), run:

```sh
python scrape_state_daily_averages.py
```

- To scrape [metro gas price daily averages](https://gasprices.aaa.com/state-gas-price-averages/), run:

```sh
python scrape_metro_daily_averages.py
```

## Historical Backfill

Every daily scrape is retained — older CSVs are never deleted, so
`data/state-daily-averages/` and `data/metro-daily-averages/` build a complete
time series over time.

Earlier history (October 2021 – April 2024) can be imported from the R-based
[ScrapeUSGasPrices](https://github.com/gueyenono/ScrapeUSGasPrices) project.
Clone it next to this repository and run:

```sh
python backfill_from_r_repo.py --r-repo ../ScrapeUSGasPrices
```

The script converts that project's city/state CSVs into this repository's
schema and writes them into the `data/` folders, skipping any dates that are
already present. It uses only the Python standard library.

## Data Exploration
The scraped data are saved in `csv` format, and may be found under `data` folder.

- Explore part of the data using `pandas`, use:
```python
import pandas as pd

# file = "./data/metro-daily-averages/2023-12-27.csv"
file = "./data/state-daily-averages/2023-12-27.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file)

df.info()
```

- To explore all the data using `pandas`, use:
```python
import glob
import pandas as pd

# files = glob.glob("./data/metro-daily-averages/*.csv")
files = glob.glob("./data/state-daily-averages/*.csv")
dfs = [pd.read_csv(file) for file in files]
df = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)

df.info()
```
